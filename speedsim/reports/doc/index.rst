Introduction
============
*reports* is a python module for generating reports from data-analysis tools and scripts.
The implementation separates report content from actual rendering allowing the same report generated by a tool to be rendered into HTML/Excel/text or uploaded into a database.

The report definition can be constructed incrementally or with a single statement.
Report objects are hierarchical in structure: tables/charts/text can be grouped into sections, sections can be grouped into parent sections.
Top-level object is Report.

Basic styling options provided by package include TextStyle specification for tables.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

   import pandas
   from reports import *

   data = pandas.DataFrame([
     ['apples', 10, 20],
     ['oranges', 12, 25]
   ], columns=['fruit', 'count', 'weight'])

   # Create initial report with summary section
   report = Report("My Report",
     Section("Summary", PieChart("Total Weight", DataSeries(x=data['fruit'], y=data['weight'])))
   )
   # add a new section with details
   report.content.append(Section("Details", Table(data)))
   display_report(report)
